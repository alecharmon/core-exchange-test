    LimitQuery:

        Number of elements that the API consumer wishes to receive.
        Plaid has a default limit of 100 elements. If this value differs from your organization's limit for the number of items to send in one response, then pick
        the lower of the two different limits and use the lower limit to define the number of items you send on each page of a paginated response.
        Plaid then gets the next page by making a new request with the opaque `nextOffset` field that your organization returned in the latest response,
        until your organization omits `nextOffset` in the response to indicate the last page.

            contact information in the full `AccountHolder` schema, Plaid doesn't consume these associations.
            Instead, Plaid consumes limited information for each `AccountHolder` and doesn't associate contact information such as emails,
            addresses, or telephone numbers to account holders.

        For Investment accounts, Plaid consumes the same level of detail for all account types.

        For Loan accounts, Plaid consumes more detailed information for:

        If your organization sends `MEMO` in this `DebitCreditMemo` enum, Plaid
        handles this value the same as it handles `DEBIT`.
        * `DEBIT`: An amount leaves the account
