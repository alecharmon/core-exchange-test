// AccountContact - Contact information for the account.
type AccountContact struct {

	// Owners of the account. Plaid expects your organization to return an empty array if this information isn't available. Note that while the [FDX specification]((https://financialdataexchange.org) enables associating holders and their contact information in the full `AccountHolder` schema, Plaid doesn't consume these associations. Instead, Plaid consumes limited information for each `AccountHolder` and doesn't associate contact information such as emails, addresses, or telephone numbers to account holders. For more information about Plaid's data model for account contact information, see [Identity](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/identity/).
