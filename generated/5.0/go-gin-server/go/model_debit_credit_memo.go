package openapi
// DebitCreditMemo : The posting type of a transaction. The transaction amount is an absolute value, and this parameter indicates the direction of the transaction. Plaid expects `DEBIT` or `CREDIT` for this enum. Plaid expects that your organization indicates the `MEMO` (i.e., pending) status using the `status` field in the transaction response rather than this field. If your organization sends `MEMO` in this `DebitCreditMemo` enum, Plaid handles this value the same as it handles `DEBIT`. * `DEBIT`: An amount leaves the account * `CREDIT`: An amount enters the account * `MEMO`: A pending transaction to be completed at the end of this day.

// List of DebitCreditMemo

	CREDIT DebitCreditMemo = "CREDIT"
	DEBIT DebitCreditMemo = "DEBIT"
	MEMO DebitCreditMemo = "MEMO"
