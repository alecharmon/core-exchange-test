// DepositAccount - Information for a deposit account type. Plaid consumes the same information for the `GET /accounts/{accountID}` for all deposit accounts. For all monetary amounts, for example for `currentBalance`, Plaid expects a decimal amount, with two places to represent fractional values of the base currency, for example `101.99`. 
type DepositAccount struct {
