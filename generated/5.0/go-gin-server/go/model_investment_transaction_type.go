// InvestmentTransactionType : The type of an investment transaction. Plaid maps these enums to Plaid [investment transaction types](https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#investment-transaction-types-schema). Plaid doesn't map these enums to Plaid-specific transaction subtypes. Plaid maps these enums as follows:  * ADJUSTMENT - fee * ATM - cash * CASH - cash * CHECK - cash * CLOSURE - Plaid suggests using SOLDTOCLOSE, PURCHASETOCLOSE, OPTIONEXERCISE or OPTIONEXPIRATION to indicate the specific type of closure, instead of using this enum. * CLOSUREOPT - Plaid suggests using SOLDTOCLOSE, PURCHASETOCLOSE, OPTIONEXERCISE or OPTIONEXPIRATION to indicate the specific type of closure, instead of using this enum. * CONTRIBUTION - buy (if transaction involves a security) or cash * DEP - cash * DEPOSIT - cash * DIRECTDEBIT - cash * DIRECTDEP - cash * DIV - cash * DIVIDEND - cash * DIVIDENDREINVEST - buy * EXPENSE - cash * FEE - fee * INCOME - cash * INTEREST - cash * INVEXPENSE - cash * JRNLFUND - transfer * JRNLSEC - transfer * MARGININTEREST - cash * OPTIONEXERCISE - transfer * OPTIONEXPIRATION - transfer * OTHER - cash - (unclassified) * PAYMENT - cash * POS - cash * PURCHASED - buy * PURCHASEDTOCOVER - buy * PURCHASETOCLOSE - buy * PURCHASETOOPEN - buy * REINVESTOFINCOME - buy * REPEATPMT - cash * RETURNOFCAPITAL - cash * SOLD - sell * SOLDTOCLOSE - sell * SOLDTOOPEN - sell * SPLIT - transfer * SRVCHG - fee * TRANSFER - transfer * XFER - transfer
